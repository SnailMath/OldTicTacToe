# OldTicTacToe
This is a simple TicTacToe game for the ClasspadII (aka fx-cp400) calculator. The game is written in basic.

There are two old versions (0402 and 0701) and the current version 0800. So just download TTT_0800 and load it via USB onto the calc.
Import it over Settings -> View storage and import. And Play it with Menu -> 2nd page -> Program -> TTT_0800 and press the arrow.
